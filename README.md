# rainforest_eagle3

I made a new Home Assistant integration for the Rainforest Eagle energy monitors,
because the upstream one is broken and the maintainers don't seem to have been responding
to issues or PRs for over a year at this point.

I'm not entirely sure why upstream is broken, but it's also a little hacky so i decided
to just start fresh mostly as a way to learn more about how hassio integrations work.

in theory if you add this repo to HACS as a custom repository, you should be able to install it,
and it might even work!

if it gets to the point where i think people other than me could use it, i'll update this,
and probably attempt to upstream changes to the aioeagle libary and the official integration. or something.
